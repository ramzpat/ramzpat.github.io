This is a personal page for making some toy projects that I am interested in. 

## Ongoing projects 
- [Pokemon SV Sandwich finder](https://github.com/ramzpat/pkm-sandwich-recipe)
  - Live Demo: https://ramzpat.github.io/pkm-sandwich-finder/
  - Use `Typescript` because I want to learn how to build a client-based Webapp and `Typescript` seems good for maintenance. 

## Plan projects
- Pokedex Webapp 
  - inspired by [pokedex.org](pokedex.org)
